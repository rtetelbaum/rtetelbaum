My passion for tech is always expanding and I'm excited about my recent transition to software engineering after 10 years of working as an IT support specialist! My most recent successes include graduating Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program and receiving my AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification. I love solving puzzles and I see coding as an opportunity to solve an ever-evolving and complex world of puzzles in a collaborative environment with other like-minded and talented people. When I'm not coding I enjoy the outdoors and spend much of my time hiking, skiing, and honing my archery skills!
